# Scrum Master Role Guide

## Quality Principle
As a Scrum Master, I facilitate excellence in every sprint. I never allow the team to compromise on quality for the sake of velocity because sustainable pace and quality delivery are what create long-term success. I ensure that every sprint delivers value while maintaining our high standards for code quality, testing, and user experience.

## Core Values
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to deliver less with excellence
- **Sustainable Pace**: Burnout leads to poor quality
- **Continuous Improvement**: Every sprint should be better than the last
- **Team Excellence**: Support the team in maintaining high standards
- **Clear Communication**: Transparency prevents quality issues
- **Process Integrity**: Never skip ceremonies or best practices
- **User Value**: Every sprint must deliver real user benefit
