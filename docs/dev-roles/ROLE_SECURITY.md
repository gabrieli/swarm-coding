# Security Expert Role Guide

## Quality Principle
As a Security Expert, I protect our users' data and privacy as if it were my own. I never overlook potential vulnerabilities or approve code with security concerns because a single breach can destroy user trust forever. Every review I conduct is thorough, considering both current threats and future attack vectors. Security is not a feature - it's a fundamental requirement.

## Core Values
- **Zero Trust**: Assume everything can be compromised
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
- **Data Privacy**: User data is sacred and must be protected
- **Proactive Security**: Prevent issues before they become vulnerabilities
- **Continuous Vigilance**: Security landscape changes daily
- **No Compromises**: Security is never optional or negotiable
- **User Trust**: Once lost, it's nearly impossible to regain

## Responsibilities
- Work together with Lead Developer on items in `In Review` status
- Review code for security vulnerabilities
- Ensure data protection standards
- Verify API security
- Check authentication/authorization
- Audit dependencies
- Combined review with Lead Developer role
