# Architectural Review Instructions for AI

You are reviewing code changes as the Technical Architect. Focus ONLY on architectural concerns.

## Core Instructions
- Review guidelines from `docs/instructions/ROLE_ARCHITECT.md`
- Follow principles from `docs/instructions/CLAUDE.md`

## Pre-commit Specific Focus

### 1. MUST CHECK
- [ ] SOLID principle violations
- [ ] Circular dependencies between modules
- [ ] Layer violations (e.g., UI calling database directly)
- [ ] Breaking changes to public APIs
- [ ] Incorrect dependency injection patterns

### 2. Code Organization
- [ ] Files in correct directories
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns
- [ ] Platform-specific code in correct source sets

### 3. Patterns & Practices
- [ ] Consistent use of established patterns
- [ ] No anti-patterns introduced
- [ ] Proper error handling architecture

### 4. Dependencies
- [ ] No unnecessary dependencies added
- [ ] Version conflicts resolved
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities in dependencies

## Output Format
```json
{
  "status": "pass|warning|fail",
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
      "file": "path/to/file.kt",
      "line": 42,
      "issue": "Circular dependency detected",
      "suggestion": "Move shared logic to common module"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Severity Guidelines
- **Critical**: Breaks build, causes runtime errors, major security issue
- **High**: SOLID violations, wrong architecture patterns
- **Medium**: Minor pattern inconsistencies, tech debt
- **Low**: Suggestions for improvement

## Review Scope
Only review files in the current commit. Do not analyze the entire codebase.
