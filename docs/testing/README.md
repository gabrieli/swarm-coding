# Project Testing Documentation

Welcome to the project testing documentation. This guide provides comprehensive information about testing practices, conventions, and guidelines for your multi-platform project.

## Overview

This testing strategy supports multi-platform architectures with:

- **Core Tests**: Business logic tests that verify core functionality
- **Platform-Specific Tests**: Platform-specific implementation tests
- **UI Tests**: Automated UI testing for each platform
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing with external services

*Note: For specific technology stacks (e.g., Kotlin Multiplatform), see relevant guides in `docs/modules/`*

## Documentation Structure

### Core Testing Guides

- [Unit Testing](./UNIT_TESTING.md) - Writing and running unit tests across platforms
- [UI Testing](./UI_TESTING.md) - Automated UI testing for iOS and Android
- [Integration Testing](./INTEGRATION_TESTING.md) - Testing external service integrations
- [Test Coverage](./TEST_COVERAGE.md) - Coverage requirements and measurement
- [Troubleshooting](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) - Common issues and solutions

## Quick Start

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Example commands - adapt to your build system and platform

# Run all tests
./run-tests.sh --all

# Run platform-specific tests
./run-tests.sh --platform=<platform-name>

# Run specific test suite
./run-tests.sh --suite=unit
./run-tests.sh --suite=integration
./run-tests.sh --suite=ui
```

*See platform-specific documentation for detailed test commands.*

## Test Organization

### Directory Structure

A typical multi-platform project structure:
```
your-project/
├── core/                      # Core business logic
│   └── tests/                 # Core tests
├── platform-a/                # Platform A implementation
│   ├── tests/                 # Platform A unit tests
│   └── ui-tests/              # Platform A UI tests
└── platform-b/                # Platform B implementation
    ├── tests/                 # Platform B unit tests
    └── ui-tests/              # Platform B UI tests
```

*Adapt this structure to your specific project needs and technology stack.*

## Testing Principles

### 1. Test Pyramid
We follow the test pyramid approach:
- **Unit Tests** (70%): Fast, isolated tests for individual components
- **Integration Tests** (20%): Tests for component interactions
- **UI Tests** (10%): End-to-end user flow tests

### 2. Platform Parity
Ensure equivalent test coverage across platforms:
- Shared business logic tested in common tests
- Platform-specific implementations tested separately
- UI behaviors tested on both iOS and Android

### 3. Test Naming Conventions

Use descriptive test names that clearly indicate:
- What is being tested
- Under what conditions
- What the expected outcome is

Example patterns:
- `testFunctionName_WhenCondition_ExpectedBehavior`
- `function_shouldBehavior_whenCondition`
- `given_when_then` format

Consult your language/framework conventions for specific naming guidelines.

### 4. Test Independence
- Each test should be independent and not rely on other tests
- Use proper setup and teardown methods
- Avoid shared mutable state between tests

## Continuous Integration

Our CI/CD pipeline runs tests automatically:

1. **Pull Request Checks**
   - All unit tests must pass
   - Code coverage must meet minimum thresholds
   - UI tests run on key user flows

2. **Main Branch Protection**
   - No direct commits to main
   - All tests must pass before merge
   - Coverage reports generated automatically

## Getting Help

- Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common issues
- Review platform-specific guides for detailed instructions
- Consult the example tests in the codebase

## Contributing

When adding new features:
1. Write tests first (TDD approach encouraged)
2. Ensure tests pass on all platforms
3. Update documentation if testing approach changes
4. Include tests in your pull request
